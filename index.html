    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="small">Effective date: November 4, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>QTIXGO</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use our mobile application and related services (collectively, the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information you provide directly and information we gather automatically when you use the App.</p>

    <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Email address, display name, and any profile information you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial entries:</strong> Transaction titles, amounts, dates, categories, notes, and other data you enter into the App for the purpose of tracking expenses, income, budgets, or savings goals. <em>We do not require or collect full bank credentials unless you choose to connect a third-party financial service (see Section 4).</em></li>
      <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> Messages, feedback, or other content you send to our support team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the App, including features used, session lengths, and crash reports.</li>
      <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system, app version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics and diagnostics:</strong> Anonymous or pseudonymous data used to improve performance and troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features.</li>
      <li>To process and store your financial entries and account settings.</li>
      <li>To respond to your questions and provide customer support.</li>
      <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or other harmful activities.</li>
      <li>To send important notices, such as changes to this policy or terms of service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Legal Bases for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in jurisdictions that require it (for example, the European Economic Area), we rely on legal bases such as your consent, performance of a contract, or our legitimate interests to operate the App and improve our services.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
    <p>The App may offer optional integrations with third-party services (for example, bank aggregators or cloud backup providers). If you choose to connect such services, you may provide credentials or grant access via secure token-based authorization. We do not store your full bank login credentials unless explicitly and securely requested; instead, we rely on industry-standard connectors where available.</p>

    <p>Third-party services have their own privacy policies and terms. Please review those policies before enabling integrations. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may disclose information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may share information with vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf (hosting, analytics, customer support, payment processors).</li>
      <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> When required by law, legal process, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction (we will notify affected users when required by law).</li>
      <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share information when you give explicit permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We and our partners use cookies, web beacons, mobile identifiers, and similar technologies to operate and improve the App, understand usage patterns, and deliver analytics. On mobile devices, we may use platform-provided identifiers (such as IDFA on iOS or Advertising ID on Android) only if you permit advertising or analytics tracking under your device settings.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. These measures include encryption of data in transit (TLS) and encryption or strong access controls for stored data where appropriate. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with our legal obligations. If you delete your account, we will remove or anonymize your personal data within a commercially reasonable timeframe unless we must retain certain information to comply with legal obligations or to resolve disputes.</p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Ask us to correct inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your personal data (subject to exceptions).</li>
      <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Request a portable copy of your data in a common format.</li>
      <li><strong>Objection / Restriction:</strong> Object to or request restriction of certain processing activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:truyaltyventure@gmail.com">truyaltyventure@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity before taking action on your request.</p>

    <h2>10. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), including the right to know, delete, and opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information. We do not sell personal information for monetary consideration. To exercise your California privacy rights or to submit a request, please contact us at <a href="mailto:truyaltyventure@gmail.com">truyaltyventure@gmail.com</a> with "California Privacy Request" in the subject line.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. When we transfer personal data internationally, we will take appropriate steps to protect it, such as using Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms where required.</p>

    <h2>12. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:truyaltyventure@gmail.com">truyaltyventure@gmail.com</a> and we will take steps to delete the information.</p>

    <h2>13. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. Please review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice within the App or by other means, and update the effective date above.</p>
